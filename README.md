# Wireframe Game (engine)

Simple game/game engine made in C++ using the [RayLib library](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for its backend.

I will not keep the readme up to date until the product is at a state i am happy with
and with enough content so i can write a meaningfull readme, with documentation and such.

Currently refactoring the whole project, you can check it out under the "refactor" branch!

Please check on its brother project [Wireframe Editor](https://github.com/LeaoMartelo2/wireframe_editor).
a tool to generate/edit maps for the engine.
