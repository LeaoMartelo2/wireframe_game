 - [X] - Add scene manager
 - [X] - move player in to scene manager, so the same player instance can be loaded between different scenes

 - [ ] re-add props and moveable entities in the game
 - [ ] add triggers for in game level loading



 - [ ] improve movimentation code to avoid getting stuck at geometry (raycast the step maybe?)
 - [ ] add a distance parameter to collision checking (no need to check collision on something far away)
